      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Liliane Lendvai, currently a Software Development Student at Code Fellows. Iâ€™m pursuing a career in software development, as Iâ€™m interested in ideating and creating technologies for the good of all people and our planet. Prior to pursuing a career in coding, I was an executive recruiter, where I learned first-hand the benefits of bringing diverse talent and perspectives to the table. I also have experience as a music instructor, which brought me fulfillment through teaching others concrete skills and promoting their creativity abilities. I align best with companies that care about the ethics behind the technologies theyâ€™re making, that have ambitious goals and take measurable action to make it happen, and that value their employees for who they are holistically.",
